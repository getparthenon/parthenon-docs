The common libary is common functionality that is used throughout Parthenon as well as common functionality that nearly every company uses throughout their application. Here there will not only be how to use this functionality but design decisions on why the code is designed in such a way and why it's thought that this will help you build cleaner, flexible, debuggable and scalable applications.

* [Logging](logging.md) - The logging helpers provided with Parthenon.
* [PDF](pdf.md) - The PDF generation helper.
* [File Uploads](upload.md) - The File upload helper
* [Repositories](repositories.md) - Information about how databases should be interacted with.
